## CO2 Sensors
>CO2Meter.com offers a variety of sensors.
Each Sensor is optimized for a specific application.
Please choose an appropriate sensor for your project requirements.

### Ambient CO2 Sensors
>For measuring atmospheric CO2 levels, plant growth, indoor air quality and applications with CO2 levels below 1%.
